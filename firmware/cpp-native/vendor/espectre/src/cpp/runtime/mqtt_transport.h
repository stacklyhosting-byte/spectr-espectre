 * The MQTT client seam.
 *
 * Implement it to carry ESPectre Protocol messages over an MQTT stack you
 * already own, then hand the instance to a frontend. `EspIdfMqttTransport`
 * (`mqtt_transport_esp_idf.h`) is the shipped implementation over `esp-mqtt`.
 *
 * Topic layout and payload schemas live in
 * [API.md](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/blob/main/docs/API.md), and
 * `espectre_protocol.h` builds the payloads, so an implementation only has to
 * move bytes.
 *
 * @par Contract for implementers
 * - The transport is driven from the frontend's task: `loop()` is where you
 *   pump your client and deliver queued callbacks.
 * - Publishing while disconnected must fail cleanly rather than block.
 * - Registered subscriptions must survive a reconnect. Callers subscribe once
 *   and expect the broker subscription to be reissued on the next connect.

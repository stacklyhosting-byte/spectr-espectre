/*
 * ESPectre - Evaluation Cadence
 *
 * Decides when the detector is due for an evaluation, from the packets' own
 * arrival timestamps rather than from a packet count.
 *
 * Owned in one place because two callers need the same answer: the steady-state
 * detection path, and the startup calibration interceptor. They used to decide
 * separately, and calibration always counted packets while detection counted
 * elapsed time, so on an off-nominal stream the threshold was fitted at a
 * different feature resolution than the one it was applied at.
 *
 * Keep aligned with RuntimeMotionPolicy in
 * tools/lib/runtime_policy.py.

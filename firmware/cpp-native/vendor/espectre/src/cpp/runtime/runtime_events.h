/**
 * Everything the runtime tells your firmware.
 *
 * Subclass it, override only what your product reacts to, and install it with
 * `RuntimeFrontendController::setup(listener)`. Every callback has an empty
 * default, so an integration that only cares about motion overrides one method.
 *
 * @par Threading and reentrancy
 * Callbacks are always delivered on the caller's task, never from an interrupt
 * or the Wi-Fi driver:
 * - Sensing events (motion, readiness, periodic, live telemetry, calibration
 *   progress, and detector-driven threshold adaptation) originate in the CSI
 *   callback but are deferred through an internal mailbox and dispatched from
 *   `loop()`.
 * - Control-driven events (threshold writes, detector selection, and manual
 *   recalibration) fire inline on whichever task called the corresponding
 *   control method.
 *
 * `on_threshold_changed()` covers every threshold source: a setter, a
 * calibration result, or Lightweight settled-level recovery.
 *
 * Keep callbacks bounded and non-blocking. Slow work delays the next `loop()`
 * iteration and can fill the bounded CSI mailbox, causing incoming frames to be
 * dropped. Queue network publication, NVS writes, and other potentially
 * blocking work for another task. Calling back into the controller is allowed,
 * with one exception noted on `on_runtime_fault()`.
 *
 * @par Snapshot lifetime
 * The `snapshot` reference is only valid for the duration of the call. Copy it
 * if you need it later.
 *
 * @par Readiness
 * Snapshots are delivered during startup calibration as well. Gate anything
 * user-visible on `RuntimeSnapshot::ready_to_publish` so you do not report
 * motion from an uncalibrated detector.
